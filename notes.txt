- Try DQN with robosuite
- Need to optimize hyperparameters (I think it should be working, env seems fine?)
- No results yet to clearly show it works... guess run for longer?

- Task for human and robot: grabbing object
Human strategy i think is grab on opposite side?
So they pick a side at start and stick with it,
then if robot grabs same side they switch as well
